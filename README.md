> This is the unofficial fix of coolhud TF2C port by xXtremePilgrimXx and Skyrym.

**COOL HUD features a lot of customization options, check all the addons & extras on the mod file!**

COOL HUD is a modified version of the default TF2 HUD with my personal style.
It's called cool because i tried my best to make it look cool while being functional at the same time.

It feautes some new interesting HUD designs, additions, and animations, it also features a variant for the minmode that pushes your vital info in the game more to the center of the screen, i recommend you to make this bind: (BindToggle "key" cl_hud_use_minmode) so you can quickly swap HUD layout in the middle of a game.

This mod changes the overheal colour to yellow, only for the HUD, but there's an extra file that changes the overheal particles colour to yellow aswell, but only works with sv_pure 0 (the particles).

The class tokens icons are only applied on the loadout selection screen, the class selection in game and the spy disguise kit icons are the default ones.

I hope it works fine for everyone, i made this steam group to report issues or anything you want about the HUD, and i'll try my best to fix them.

Big thanks to all the cool people on the W.I.P. page who liked and commented, i really appriciate all of the comments.

### Notes
I used Notepad++, VTF editor and Photoshop to make this.

My inspiration comes from many games that have symmetrical and dynamic looking HUDS, like: DOOM (2016), KF2... and... many more i can't remember right now!

#### Known Issues
1. Active timer glow (classic timers aka "tf_use_match_hud 0") not working in minmode.
2. Health icon showing on the weapon pickup panel.
3. Hud materials doesn't work in DirectX 8.
